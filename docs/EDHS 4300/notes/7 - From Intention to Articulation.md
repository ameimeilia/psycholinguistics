# From Intention to Articulation

## Producing Speech
- the speaker’s job is to **encode** an idea into an utterance
- the utterance must contain **all the linguistic information** the listener needs
- **preverbal message**: the idea or information that speaker instends to communicate
- this message must be matched with linguistic information by mental operations before it can be shared
- word selection, syntactic structures, morphology, phonology before speaking

## Planning Speech
**Operations/Representations**
1. Lexical: choosing words
2. Syntactic: deciding on and building the sentence structure
3. Morphological: word endings, inflections
4. Phonological: identifying the sounds

**Steps**
1. create a representation of the intended sentence meaning
2. a lexical search is triggered for the words
3. assign syntactic structure to the words retrieved from lexicon
4. phonological representation can be create
5. instructions are generated for the vocal apparatus
6. speech signal is created

## Speech Errors
- **Spoonerisms**: speech error where the initial sounds of two words get swapped
	- indication of how linguistic information is stored and organized
- **Freudian Slip**: slips of the tongue, of which Freud proposed they revealed repressed thoughts
- slips can also happen in sign language and written language→ indicate that language is organized in an hierarchical way

**Typical Slips of the Tongue**
- anticipation errors
- perseveration errors
- exchange errors
- omission errors

## Speech Error Suggestions about Speech Production
- speech is planned in advance
- the lexicon is organized both semantically and phonologically
- morphologically complex words are assembled
- affixes and functors behave differently from content words in slips of the tongue
- speech errors reflect rule knowledge

## Accessing the Lexicon
- the process of retrieving words is extremely rapid, people produce 100-300 words per minute
- the lexicon is organized by frequency of use and meaning
- the lexicon is also organized by **phonological structure**

## Lexicalization
- the process of finding, selecting a word, and preparing it to be spoken
- widespread agreement that it is a two-stage process:
	1. **meaning** based
	2. **phonologically** based
- **lexical selection**: choosing the word (lemma level)
- **phonological encoding**: retrieving the phonological forms of these words (lexeme level / form level)

## Lemma
- Lemma: level of representation of a word between semantic and phonological representation; syntactically specifies, **does not contain sound-level information**; the intermediate stage of two stage models of lexicaliztation
- **Lemma Selection**: stage of specifying in a **pre-phonological**, abstract way the word that we are about to say

## Lexeme (form)
- **Lexeme**: the level that contains **phonological information of the word**- what the sounds are, and how the sounds are sequenced
- **Lexeme/phonological form selection**: stage of specifying actual concrete phonological form of the word

## Evidence for Two Stages
- **speech errors**: two distinct types of whole word substitution speech error: semantic substitutions, and form-based substitutions, or **malapropisms**
- **neuroscience**: difference regions of the brain become activated in sequence as we produce words
- **tip-of-the-tongue**: extreme form of a pause, where the word takes a noticeable time to come out\

## Tip of the tongue phenomenon
- **inability to activate speech because insufficient access to the lexical element**
- indication that the semantic identification and phonological activation are two different sub-processes (partial activation hypothesis)
- alternative theory: target item is suppressed by a stronger competitor (blocking hypothesis)

## Syntactic Planning
- **word order** in speech is determined by a number of factors that interact
- speakers construct sentences so they provide **given before new information**
	- SVO order
	- topic → comment
	- old information → new information

## Syntactic Priming
- a particular sentence is more likely to occur if the speaker has recently heard a sentence in that form
- speakers tend to **reuse the syntactic constructions of other speakers**
- the **syntactic form of the prime influences resulting behavior**
- this is sometimes interpreted as evidence that form (syntax) and content (semantics) are two separate phenomena in language production

## Syntactic Challenges: Dependencies
- **number-agreement errors**: number agreement between subjects and verbs is incorrect
- this is partially a surface phenomenon (effect of the nearby word)
- difference between notional number and grammatical number
- this phenomenon is even more clear in words such as “scissors” and “pants” which are grammatically plural but notionally singular

## Phonological Encoding: Frame-based Models
- ensuring that the sounds of words come out in the appropriate order, with the appropriate prosody
- linguistic structures create **frames** with slots, and we retrieve linguistic content to fill these slots
- **a frame is stored for each word** we know
- sound segments are retrieved separately and **inserted into appropriate slots** in a syllabic frame
- when we speak, we produce an abstract frame for the upcoming phrase

## Hesitations
- **unfilled pause**: is simply a moment of silence
- **filled hesitation**: can be filled pause, a repetition, a false start, or a parenthetical remark

## Summary
- speech requires a complex coordination of planning and prodcution
- underlying the actual production of speech is the abstract representation of individual words
- the speaker transmits the speech signal, which is the outcome of this process
