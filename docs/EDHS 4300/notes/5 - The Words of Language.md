# The Words of Language

## Acquiring Words
1. first word appears around first birthday
2. basic level of 50 words around 18-24 months
3. vocabulary spurt - growth to 10,000s of words

- word learning has both a productive and a receptive side: recognizing words and saying words
- children try to match their productions with their internal representation of a word
- babies pay attention to differences - but not to “similar” words, even if they have the phonological-analytical skills to do so

- **”less is more”**: the fact that infants have limited experiences will make it easier to build internal language

- after reaching 50 word vocabulary:
	1. **vocabulary spurt** of 4-8 words everyday
	2. **fast mapping**: when a child hears a word once or twice, learns its grammatical class, but has only a vague sense of what it means

- disparities emerge very early in life among children living with college-educated parents, working-class parents, and low-income parents living on welfare

## Mechanisms of Word Learning
- **associative learning**: association between word and an object, person, event, characteristic in the environment
- **reinforcement**: through repetition/generalization
- children learn best through **human interaction**
- **joint attention**: children pay attention to the speaker’s intention to determine the meaning of a word

- **whole-object bias**: the theoretical assumption by babies that a new word heard in the context of a salient object refers to the whole thing and not to its parts

**Strategies children use to figure out word meanings**
1. *reference*: assume that words map to objects, actions and attributes
2. *extendability*: assume that words label more than just the original referent
3. *object scope*: assume that words that appear to map to objects map to the whole opject
4. *novel name - nameless category*: assume that novel words map to concepts for which you do not yet have a name
5. *conventionality*: assume that speakers prefer specific rather than general terms

- **prototype**: a relatively abstract mental representation that assembles the key attributes or features that best represent instances of a given category

**Early vocabulary: salient words**
1. *overextension*: when the child will extend a word incorrectly to similar things
2. *under-extension*: the child will acquire a word for a particular thing and fail to extend it to other objects in the same category

**Lexical difficulties**
- lexical growth: number of words
- lexical organization: phonological, syntactic, semantic

## Words as Linguistic Labels
- words are social constructs and are the result of *conventionalization*
- are essentially *arbitrary*
- do children understand the social underpinnings of language, know that names are used by speakers to refer?

**Words are learned in context**
- social - communicative context: who is saying what, when , which accompanying events, etc
- linguistic context: words are stringed together

## Syntactic Structures to Understand Words
- the mental lexicon contains information what certain lexical elements can or cannot be connected with

**Linguistic information used to deduce the meanings of words**
1. *argument structures*: syntactic frames that provide information about how many objects are involved in each event, what kind of objects or participants are involved, etc
2. *intransitive verb*: a verb with only on participant (subject)
3. *transitive verb*: a verb with two participants (subject and object)
4. *ditransitive verb*: a verb with three participants (subject, object, indirect object)

- **syntactic bootstrapping**: words, presented in their syntactic frames, provide a source of information about their meaning

## Morphological Structures to Understand Words
- the morphological system helps us to generate and organize words
	1. -er: sing → singer, teach → teacher
	2. -s: apple → apples, lemon → lemons
- morphemes are combined in a rule-governed hierarchy
	1. nation
	2. nation-al
	3. national-ize
	4. re-nationalize
	5. nationalz-ation
	6. re-nationalization
	7. renationalization-s
- morphemes are an indication of how much a child is able to build language with the smallest meaningful elements

**Regular vs. irregular verbs**
- regular: accept → accepted, beg → begged, hammer → hammered
- irregular: begin → began, forget → forgot, give → gave
- initially, developing children tend to treat irregular verbs as regular verbs

- people with Parkinson’s disease or Broca aphasia may have difficulties with regular verbs
- people with Alzheimer’s disease or Wernicke aphasia may have intact processing or regular verbs

**Accessing morphological knowledge**
- the “Wug” study (Berko)
- “this is a wug. Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two _ _ _ ”

**Mean length of utterance**
- as sentences lengthen, *mean length of utterance (MLU)* increases
- MLU = total number of morphemes / total number of utterances
- MLU correlates to age
- sentences become longer when the child’s working memory becomes large enough to hold more info at a given time

## Language and Thought
1. cognitive development determines the course of language development
2. language and cognition are independent
3. language and cognition become interdependent
- Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: the form of our language determines the structure of our thought process

**Whorf linguistic relativism**
- compared Indian American languages (Hopi) with SAE
	- SAE: “in the morning”
	- Hopi: “while the morning phase is passing”
- “All observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated”

**Color coding and memory for color**
Brown and Lenneberg:
- memory for “color chips” differing in hue, brightness, and saturation
- codable colors, which correspond to simple color names, are remembered more easily

**Coding of Space and Time**
- there is evidence that the ways in which different languages encode distinctions influence the ways in which speakers think
- these difference suggest that our languages many influence how we perform on tasks that at first sight do not seem to involve language at all

## Conclusion
- environment and biology jointly determine out basic cognitive architecture
- a significant proportion of our mental life is conducted in language
- there can be cultural differences
- there is much evidence that language and culture can affect our ways of thinking
- language and though are related in a complex way
