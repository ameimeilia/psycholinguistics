# Diversity and Bilingualism

## Speech, Language and Diversity
- speech and language use is pathological when it is the result of an **absence or distortion of structures or functions**
- **patholinguistics**: study of language disorders

## Speech and the Speech Organs
- we can **produce sounds in many ways**
- not all sounds are speech sounds
- we are **not using our speech organs fully**
- we use speech organs to produce sounds in a **perceptually (binary) decodable system (phonology)**

## Speech and Evolution
- there are **no proper speech organs** (speech organs have original non-speech related functions)
- **evolutionary linguistics**: studies how language has emerged as part of human evolution
- **hypothesis**: language evolved as an adaptation shaped by natural selection
- **alternative hypothesis**: language emerged as a side effect of something else (brain size, increase in general intelligence, upright walking)
- language capacity must have arisen when **homo sapiens** became differentiated from other species and brain increased in size and complexity
- **Broca’s area** was present in the brains of hominids 2 millions years ago

## Why Speech?
- the phonology of language can be described as **binary systems** (voiced - non voiced, etc.)
- human speech organs offer exceptional possibilities to use this principle
- **alternatives do exist: manual sign languages**

## The Monogenesis and Polygenesis Hypotheses
- **monogenesis**: all languages descend from one proto-human language
- **poly-genesis**: the same cognitive linguistic organization that allows the emergence of a languages causes the birth of language in separate communities around the world

## Linguicide/Linguicism
- **linguicide**: death of a language from natural or political causes
- **linguicism**: bias, discrimination, harassment, maltreated based on language stereotypes

## Where Speech Diversity Occurs
- individual speech organs/anatomical differences
	- lips and teeth, velum and palate, velopharyngeal port
- central steering and coordinating mechanisms in the brain
- the language that an individual is exposed to

## Neurological Pathology
- neurogenic disorders
- a problem emerges from organization within the brain, or from communication between the brain and articulators
- examples: Parkinson’s disease, Ataxia, Apraxia of speech

## Influence of Speech Modeling and Language Style Environment
- people around us provide us with **speech models** all the time
- this is the case **throughout life** but especially in younger years, when an internal phonololgy is being built
- result of local and geographical differences

## Sociolect, Dialect, Idiolect
- **sociolect**: a variety of language use that is related to a social or socioeconomic group
	- professional jargon, youth slang, internet and text speak
- **dialect**: a variety of language as used by a group, often determined by geographical regions or localities
- **idiolect**: a variety of language use by one individual (we all have our individual way of speaking and using language)
	- choice of vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar and syntax
- **ecolect**: the way a language is used with a small group (such as a household)
	- pet names and vocabulary, inside jokes and phrases, culinary terms

## Sociophonetic Markers
- **socio-phonetic variation**: the way speech is produced is influenced by social environemnt (and identity factors)
- you adopt phonetic characteristics and style from speakers around you and speakers you identify with

## Speech and Ageing
- higher pitch voice in
