# What is Psycholinguistics?

## Grammar
- the description of language as a system
- **prescriptive grammar**: knowing how to adapt to the standard way of speaking or writing (professional use of language)
- **descriptive grammar**: is the language system that underlies ordinary use

## Assumptions of linguistics and related working hypotheses for psycholinguistics

- **challenge**: languages are different and differences can be displayed in the way the brain deals with them → cross-linguistic research/brain research

- **challenge**: are there instances where only language is damaged by not other mental functions?
- even if there is modularity, the different modules interact (ex. specific language impairment)

- **challenge**: consider sign languages?
- are the sounds of a language really meaningless?

*example* - kinesthetic symbolism

## Psychological Aspects of Human Language
**Languages are creative**
- speaks can create and understand *novel* sentences with no conscious effort
- every language consists of a set of principles that has an *infinite number* of combinations

**Humans use language to communicate thoughts**
- animals can communicate certain types of info (danger, food, etc.)
- humans can talk about *anything*

## Psycholinguistics Explains:
- how people (children) acquire language
- how people use language
- how language is represented and processed in the brain

## What is Communication?
- **communication**: the transmission of a signal that conveys information, can be *intentional or non-intentional*
- **signal**: the means that conveys the information
	1. ants: pheromones
	2. honey bees: dance
- communication can take on *several forms* / several types of signals

## What is Language?
- **language**: a structured system of symbols that contains a lexicon and combinatorial principles
- languages can be expressed in different **modalities**, mainly speech and writing
- spoken languages: most languages, expressed in the *spoken modality*
- sign languages: expressed in the gestural modality

## What is the use of Language?
- primary purpose is **communication**
- additional purposes:
	1. express emotion
	2. social interaction
	3. make use of sounds
	4. attempt to control the environment
	5. record facts
	6. **think**
	7. express identity

## What is Speech?
- **speech**: use of the human voice to produce *acoustic signals* that represent linguistic structures
- spoken languages are tailored toward production with the human voice

## Intersection of Communication, Language, and Speech
- in real life communication is multimodal → a mixture of linguistic and non-linguistic forms

## Organization of Language
- **language**: a formal system for pairing systems with meanings
- **grammar**: the set of rules that creates sentences in a language
- **lexicon**: the set of words of a language

## The Components

</div>
- **phoneme inventory**: the sounds of a language
- **phonological rules**: the sounds pattern of the language, including: making words, intonation, and rhythm
- **morphological rules**: how meaningful combinations of sounds are formed
- **syntactic rules**: structural organization of words and sentences

## Lexicon
- all the information known about a word, including; sounds, meaning, written appearance, syntactic roles
- mental lexicon: internal dictionary of all the words a person knows and the linguistic information connected with each
- **lexical semantics**: meanings of words

## Acoustics, Phonetics, and Phonology
- **acoustics**: the physical characteristics of sound
	- **acoustic phonetics**: the physical characteristics of speech sounds
- **phonetics**: the production and perception of speech sounds
	- *phoneme inventory*: the sounds of a certain language
	- *phoneme combinations*: each phonology dictates which combinations are possible
- **phonology**: the sound system of a language (sounds that go together / don’t go together)

## Morphology
- phonemes combine to form **morphemes**: the smallest unit of language that have meaning
- inflectional morphology: walk - walked, go - went, apple - apples
- derivational morphology: social - sociologist - think - thinker
- morphology can operate as an autonomous component: ex. inflectional morphology of a fictitious word

## Syntax
- when processing a sequence of words, words are matched with their meaning and their sequence within the structure

## Linguistic Competence vs. Linguistic Performance
- **linguistic competence**: intuitive knowledge of a language user that enables the creative production and understanding of all sentences
- **linguistic performance**: the use of such knowledge in the actual processing of sentences, together with skills and factors such a planning, attention, and memory

## Meta-linguistic Awareness
- ability to think consciously about language and linguistic objects (sounds, words, sentences)

## Psycholinguistics and Cognition
- thought → language → speech

## Production and Reception of Language

</div>
- **production**: thought → lexicon → syntactic encoding → linguistic encoding → speech
- **perception**: phonological decoding → lexicon → syntactic decoding → understanding

## Acquisition of Language
- similarities in the way children acquire their native language
- language is acquired rapidly → suggest biological underpinning
- second language acquisition is usually more difficult

## Neurolinguistics
- How does the brain work as the command center of language?  
- Are there different brain areas involved?  
- How are they involved?
- …

## Summary
- Linguistic theory forces us to investigate psychological questions  
- Psycholinguistics uses linguistic models to generate psychological questions  
- Psycholinguistics focuses on language acquisition, language processing, organization of language in the brain.
