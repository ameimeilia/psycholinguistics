# Speech and Language Disorders

## Language Development: Hearing Impaired
- note: hearing impairments are not language disorders
- deaf children spontaneously start using and combining complex gestures in the absence of sign language
	- strong need for humans to attempt to communicate
- **Meier**: deaf children using sign language pass the same linguistic “milestones” at about the asme ages as hearing children
- **main factor**: lack of exposure and access
- implications for:
	- phonological, morphological, syntactic development
	- semantic and lexical development
	- pragmatic development
	- form, function, and use of language

## 3 Levels of Language Disorders
1. processing disorder: ex. word finding problems
2. production disorders
3. receptive disorders

## Production Disorders
1. **Dysarthria**: impaired articulatory ability resulting from defects in the peripheral motor nerves or in the speech musculature
2. **Apraxia of speech**: person has trouble sayign what they want to say correctly and consistently
3. **Fluency disorders**: normal flow of speech is disrupted by repetitions or hesitations

## Brainstem
- damage to the central nervous system structures that are located in the brainstem typically affects speech to a profound extent
- the impairment is typically the result of an acquired condition: in most cases, it is a brainstem stroke, involving a disruption of the blood supply provided to the brainstem by the basilar artery
- **locked-in syndrome** can be caused by stroke at the level of the basilar artery denying blood to the pons, among other causes

## Spastic Dysarthria

## Amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
- starts with dysarthris/dysphagia
- progressive character
- requires strategies that limit motor requirements
- ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord

## Fluency Disorders

## Causes of Stuttering
- continuum: dysfluency in itself is not pathological
- neurological causes
- psychological effects (reinforcements)
- linguistic factors

## Childhood Language Disorders
- childhood and congenital aphasia
- dysphasia
- language delay
- language deviance
- specific language impairment (SLI)

## Language Problems Include:
- lexical problems (semantic problems)
- syntactic problems
- phonological problems
- articulation problems
- pragmatic problems (also some semantic problems)
