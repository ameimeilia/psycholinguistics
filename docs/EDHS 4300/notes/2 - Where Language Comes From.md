# Where Language Comes From
- nativist view: humans are born with language
- anti-nativist view: language is a tool that is developed by humans everywhere

## The Origin of Speech
- *The Origin of Speech* by Charles Hockett: 1960, attempt to grasp the essence/uniqueness of language
- features of human language suggested by Hockett:
	1. vocal auditory channel: language is produced in the vocal tract and transmitted as sound → language was synonymous with speech
	2. arbitrariness: the meaningful associations between language and the world are arbitrary
	3. discreteness: the units of language are separate and distinct from one another
	4. duality of patterning: meaningful words are made by the combination of a small number of elements into various sequences

## Animal communication systems
- communication systems within species that can be more or less complex
- based on codes, **mimicry** → limited **repertoire**
- have some degree of combinatorics and serve survival functions (ex. food location, alarm calls)
- information sharing of human language conflicts with survival of the fittest/competition and requires brain investment
- **Clever Hans effect**: animals that appear to know language are sometimes just picking up cues from their owner

## Ape Genius
- chimps are able to make tools
- chimps do not understand pointing
- chimps show some skills needed for the use of language, ex. cooperation
- if non-speech modalities are used, some chimps are able to learn/use more than 100 symbols
- recent studies showed that chimps can have some level of theory of mind
- chimps and children both display imitative behavior, but children imitate more

## Primate symbolic communication
- primates display no evidence of using skills in a **natural environment**
- points to interaction between **cognitive capacity and language**
- possible categories for support language:
	1. necessary to get language off the ground but aren’t specific to language (ex. symbol understanding)
	2. traits that evolved particularly because they make language more power and efficient (ex. combinatorial capacity)

## Pointing and communication
- in child development: pointing, reaching, labeling, and communication are intertwined
- primates do not understand pointing

## Cognitive and social skills
- need for a **cooperative attitude** (altruistic, sharing reciprocity)
- cooperation is based on a **complex set of implicit rules**
- importance of **joint attention** (children develop this skill during the first year of life, development of commenting and labeling)

## Duality of patterning
1. a small number of units that don’t convey meanings on their own can be used to create a very large number of symbols (rules of combination are those of phonology)
2. meaning elements combine again, following specific syntax rules

## History of Psycholinguistics
**Noam Chomsky** (1959)
- challenged the traditional view of language which focused on **vocal** behavior
- argued that **speech** should *not* be the object of study for human language, instead the **underlying rules** (in the mind) that are not observable
- argued that language is **infinite and always new (generative)** → behaviorism suggests a finite number of behaviors

- grammatical components: syntax, morphology, phonology
- 3 factors:
	1. **innate endowment**: genetic endowment that leads a child to reflexively seek evidence that is linguistically relevant
	2. **external endowment**: environment
	3. **neurological properties/learning principles**: computational efficiency, mutations over time allowed the development of a cognitive-linguistic system

## Biological predisposition
- languages across the world all share common aspects → suggest language is part of human biological endowment
- **universal grammar** and acquisition strategies must be biological
- **language acquisition device**: the portion of the brain with a predisposition for acquiring language

## Evolution of speech
- the vocal tract of humans has specific qualities
- human speech is produced by a vocal source and the vocal tract
- the vocal anatomy of human/chimpanzees is different

## Speech and Language in Children
- early on, children discover that vocal sound production can be modulated
- 6-10 months: child babbles **repetitively** combining consonants and vowels into syllable-like sequences
- **reduplicated babble**: repetition of consonant-vowel syllables, often producing the same pair for a long time (ex. “ba ba ba”)
- **non-reduplicated/variegated babble**: strings of non-repeated syllables
- **continuity hypothesis**: babbling is a direct precursor of language
- **discontinuity hypothesis**: babbling bears no simple relation to later development (it is pure motor practice)

## Evolution of Language
**Origin**
- Genesis 11:1-9: languages are God-given, language is “created on the spot”

**Creationism / Evolution**
- *Condillac* (1715-1780): French philosopher who believed that language must have *evolved* over time
- John Locke, Adam Smith, and others agreed
- argued for a gradual development of a semiotic system out of calls and *gestures*

**Modern Day**
- *continuous* views: evolutionary
- *discontinuous views*: linguistic “big bang”

## Where did Language Come From?
- 1866: Paris Societe de Linguistique banned any debate about the evolutionary origins of language
- *hypothesis*: language evolved as an adaptation shaped by natural selection
- *alternative*: it arose as a side effect of something else (ex. increase in brain size, increase in general intelligence, etc)
- language capacity must have arisen when homo sapiens became differentiated from other species (~2 million - 300,000 years ago) and brain increased in size complexity

## Were the First Languages Gestural?
- *hypothesis*: earliest forms of human language were gestural
- gestures (manual signs) can be learned and used communicatively by chimps
- apes in the wild do use gestures
- young children use gestures before they can speak
- gestures are everywhere and very much connected to speech

## Language Development of Individuals with Hearing Loss
- Susan Goldin-Meadow: studies indicate that deaf children without a (manual) signing model can develop their own manual signs
- deaf children spontaneously start using and combining complex gestures in the absence of sign language

## The Kendon Continuum
- Adam Kendon (1934-2022)
**from left to right:**
1. speech is less obligatory
2. language-like properties increase
3. idiosyncratic behaviors replaced with conventional

## Gestural systems can develop into real (sign) languages
- sign languages are used and have developed naturally
- sign languages are just as structured as spoken languages and are capable of conveying an unlimited range of topics
- the only difference between signed and spoken languages is the transmission mode

## Stokoe’s Model of Sign Structure
- signs have parts as words have parts
- each sign is composed of three parts:
	1. location: the placement on the signer’s body where the sign is made
	2. handshape: the configuration of the hands in the sign
	3. movement: how the hands/arms move in forming a sign; a sign may have up to three movements

## How Languages are Dynamic
- many languages are related
- languages change over short time spans:
	- we coin new words or new uses of old words when necessary
	- whole words drop out of usage, and we lose the meaning of some words
	- we borrow words from other languages

## Linguistic Universals
- some might be part of the **innate component** of the grammar
- some might be part of an innate component of **cognition** (organizing information that can be retained and processed)
- constraints on syntactic processing make some word orders easier to process
- ex. all languages have pronouns, languages have a dual grammatical number system

## Pidgins and Creoles
- a new language can emerge as a result of contacts between users of different languages
- **Pidgin**: simplified languages created for communication between speakers of different languages forced into prolonged contact
- **Creole**: a pidgin language that has become the native tongue of the children of the pidgin speakers
