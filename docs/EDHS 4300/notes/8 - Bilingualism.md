# Bilingualism
- how does the mental system deal with more than one language?
- condition **when two languages** are mastered by one person
- **multilingualism**: when more languages are mastered

## Interest in Bilingualism
- **psycholinguistic**: raises the question of our linguistic potential, lexical organization, critical period, phonology
- **educational**: effect on development
- **economic**: competitive edge, reaching foreign markets
- **cultural**: cultural enrichment and understanding of other cultures

## What Situations Create Bilingualism?
- geographical and political conditions (international commnication)
- immigration and emigration
- colonization
- economic and professional motivations
- linguistically blended families and neighborhoods

## Terminology
- **L1**: first language learned
- **L2**: second language learned
- **simultaneous bilingualism**: L1 and L2 learned around the same time
- **early sequential bilingualism**: L1 learned first, but L2 learned relatively early (largest group worldwide)
- **late bilingualism**: learned in adolescence +

## Diary Study of Leopold (1939-1949)
- native German in Wisconsin reporting on his daughter’s German-English acquisition
- showed that young children can quickly forget the old language and pick up a new one if they move to another country (**language attrititon**)
- initially the two languages are mixed up, but differentiation quickly emerges
- language mixing occurs when words combine (such as an English suffix added to a German root)

## Growing Up Bilingual
- research indicates that children are able **to identify and distinguish the languages in their environment** - if the environment provides clues for distinction (“one person - one language OPOL principle)
- children will learn words differently from each language depending on the **situations**
- children growing up bilingual often develop **meta-linguistic awareness** sooner than typical children

## 1913 Jules Ronjat Study
- doctoral study of the education of his son Louis
- he spoke to his son in German while his wife spoke to the son in French
- when the son begins talking, he will talk in two languages

## 1935 Smith Study
- missionaries who lived in China from 1881-1894
- diary records of the children
- older children were in OPOL situation: parents spoke English and others spoke Chinese
- younger children: both languages were mixed
- Smith compared sentence length, number of errors/hundred words, number of inflected forms of English, percentages of “mixed” sentences, number of Chinese words
- “at every age level, the older children excel the younger children by all criteria”

## Further Observations
- children growing up bilingually often show vocabulary scores in each language that are **slightly below normal** during the preschool years
- they may not have the experience of talking about every topic in both of the languages
- in general, it is assumed that children need at least **20 hours of exposure** to a language/week to acquire productive skills in it
- children, like adults, tend to lose languages they don’t often use, a phenomenon called **language attrition**

## Bilingual Language Processing
- **separate-store models**: there are separate lexicons for each language
- **common-store models**: there is ONE lexicon and ONE semantic memory system, with words from both languages stored in it and connected directly together
- **code switching**: the spontaneous ability to switch from one language to another depending on the specifics of the communication partner and environment

## In Terms of Development
- **separate underlying proficiency model (SUP)**: proficiency in the first language is viewed as entirely separate from proficiency in the second language (language development activities in the first language will not enhance learning of a second language)
- **common underlying proficiency model (CUP)**: linguistic development in any language provides a basis that will be helpful for learning another language (most evidence for this model)

## Semi-Lingualism or Limited Bilingualism
- individuals who are not competent in either their first or second language

## Additive and Subtractive Bilingualism
- **additive bilingualism**: achievement of high levels of proficiency in the first and second languages
- **subtractive bilingualism**: a situation in which a student’s first language is **replaced** by the second language (attrition)

## Processes that Co-occur with L2 Learning
- **interference**: the process wherein a language behavior from the first language is carried over to the second language
- **fossilization**: a specific second language “error” is firmly entrenched in the second language, even though the person is very proficient in the second language

## Is L1 hindering L2?
- **Pieter Muysken**: 2nd language learners may have **a lack of access to UG**, because the first language has set parameters in an irreversible way
- if the first language causes learners to set a **parameter** in a marked or more inclusive way, they may find it especially difficult to reset the parameter to the less marked or more neutral setting
	- attentive to certain things in one language but can’t reset for second language

## The Ethno-linguistic Effect
- **a majority ethno-linguistic community**: is one where the language has high social status and is widely used
- **a minority ethno-linguistic community**: is one in which the language has lower social status, is less valued, and may be associated with little socio-economic power
- language can function as a social and personal identity marker
- social identity indicates a group membership

## Educational Skepticism
- **Saer (1923)**: compared 828 Welsh-English bilingual and monoglot children in either language and 569 university student with Welsh as a native language
- “monoglots” showed considerable superiority in intelligence and vocabulary; the bilinguals were quite “confused” in dexterity
- language associated with “world view” and social identity

##  Varying Attitudes toward Bilingualism
- varying from **high prestigious to low prestigious**
- Cummins: **“Bilingualism is good for the rich but bad for the poor,”** referring to upscale rich private bilingual schools while in the same states, immigrant parents are sometimes discouraged to use their home language with their children

## Bilingual Proficiency
- **monolingual norm assumption**: the belief that mono-lingualism is the cognitive-linguistic norm and that the child’s cognitive system is fragile and only designed to cope with one language (sometimes called the **“limited capacity hypothesis”**)
- **maintenance bilingual education**: culturally appropriate learning experiences in the first language while learning the second language
- **BICS**: basic interpersonal communication skills, takes approximately **2 years** to develop to a level commensurate with that of native speakers of a langauge
- **CALP**: cognitive academic language proficiency, takes between **5-7 years** to develop to a native-like level
- but: it can take up to 7-10 years for CALP to develop to a native-like level **under less than optimal** conditions

## Context-embedded and Context-reduced communication
- **context-embedded communication**: participants can actively negotiate meaning and they have a shared reality
- **context-reduced communication**: does not assume a shared reality, it may rely exclusively on linguistic cues for meaning

## Bilingual Language Processing
- **cognates**: words that have a common etymological origin
	- beware of false cognates
- **culturally similar words**: act as though they are **stored in common**
- **abstract and other words**: act as though they are in **separate** stores
- sometimes a mixture of common and separate stores

## Bilingual Syntactic Processing
- **particular syntactic structure** in one language could make it easier to use the same structure in the second language
- supporting the idea of “shared syntax”

## Moving Between Languages
- **Kroll and Stewart**: we translate words from our first language into the second language (**forward translation**) by **conceptual mediation**
- we must access the meaning of the word to translte it'
- in contrast, we translate from the second language into the first (**backward translation**) by word association
- we can direct links between items in the lexicon
- it is likely that **translation in both directions** involves going through the semantic representation of the words
- many studies have shown that words in different languages **interfere** with one another

## The Neuroscience of Bilingualism
- there is some evidence that **bilinguals with right hemisphere damage show more aphasia** (cross aphasia) than monolinguals
- there have been a number of reports of the **selective impairment of one language following brain damage but many more of differential recovery of the two languages**
- the evidence is consistent with 2 independent language systems connected at the conceptual level
- imaging suggests that the time of acquisition most affects the grammatical aspects of language
- lexicons of both early and late bilinguals are organized similarly
- some differences: e.g. id one languages is an inflectional type language and the other language is a word-order type language

## Second Language Acquisition
- a child or adult has already become competent at a language and attempts to learn another
- why is it difficult?
	- **critical period**
	- older children and adults often have **less time and motivation** to learn a second language
	- the “less is more” hypothesis: children have smaller world when younger
	- the similarities and differences between L1 an dL2
- **contrastive hypothesis**: the learner will experience difficulty when L1 and L2 differ

## L2 Teaching Methods
- **traditional method**: based on translation from one to another, with lectures in grammar in the primary language (translation method)
- **direct methods**: carry out al teaching in L2, with emphasis on conversational skills
- **audiolingual method**: emphasizes speaking and listening before reading and writing
- **immersion method**: teaches a group of learners exclusively through the medium of the foreign language
- **submersion method**: the learner is surrounded exclusively by speakers of L2, usually in the foreign country

## Krashen 5 Hypotheses, the Monitor Model
1. **acquisition and learning distinction hypothesis**: children acquire L1 largely unconsciously and automatically, they do not learn it
2. **natural order in acquisition hypothesis**: order of acquisition of syntactic rules and the types of errors of generalization made, are the same in both languages
3. **monitor hypothesis**: acquisition processes create sentences in the second language, but learning enables the development of a monitoring process to check and edit this output
4. **comprehensible input hypothesis**: in order to move from one stage to the next, the acquirer must understand the meaning and form of the input
5. **active filter hypothesis**: attitude and emotional factors are important in L2 acquisition and account for a lot of difference in the facility with which adults and children can learn a second language

## John Carroll (1916-2003)
- identified 4 sources of variation on people’s ability to learn a new language:
	1. **phonetic coding ability**
	2. **grammatical senstitivity**
	3. **rote-learning ability**
	4. **inductive learning ability**
- **language learning aptitude**: prediction of how well, relative to other individuals, an individual can learn a foreign language in a given amount of time under given conditions

## Keith Sharpe
- 1992: “four C’s” of successful modern language teaching:
	1. **communication**
	2. **culture**
	3. **context**
	4. **confidence**
- simple rote repetition is best for learning to produce the new words, using keywords is best for comprehension

## Observations in Second Language Learning
**Silent Period**
- much listening and little output
- focus on comprehension (silent period can vary from 6 weeks to 18 months)
- not an expressive language delay

**Language Loss**
- new language gradually replaces the first language (if first language is no longer used)
- sometimes a period of low functioning in both languages

**Language Transfer (interference)**
- a characteristic or feature of the first language is carried over into the second language

**Inter-language**
- period in second language development when the learner starts to use language productively until she achieves competence to that of a native speaker
- learner is testing hypotheses about how the new language works

**Code-switching**
- the ability to easily switch from one code to the other in response to environmental cues
- code-switching is typical for bilingual individuals everywhere

**Code-mixing**
- language alternation within a sentence

## Variables that Affect 2nd Language Learning
- use of **routines** and standard expressions
- **high vs low input generators**
	- high: extravert, seeking opportunities, low anxiety
	- low: less assertive, creating less opportunities
- avoidance, modeling, personality (self-esteem, extraversion, assertiveness), anxiety level, motivation

## Summary
- there are probably both **costs and benefits** of learning two languages at once
- second language acquisition in **adulthood and later childhood** is difficult because it is not like first language acquisition
- there has been much debate as to how we translate words between languages
- **Bilingualism is a useful tool for studying other language processes**
