# The Sounds of Language

## Sound Patterns in Babies
- before babies begin to produce words, babies can:
	1. *differentiate their native language* from other languages
	2. have a sense of how *streams of sounds are sliced* into words
	3. give special attention to *distinctions in sounds that will be especially useful* for signaling different meanings
	4. figure out how sounds can be “legally” combined into words in their own language (*phonotactics*)
- at the end of the first year of life, children typically have learned to recognize the phonemes of the language used around them

## Biological Predisposition
- **acquisition strategies** enable the child to take the input from the environment and construct a grammar the conforms to the *organizational principles* of universal grammar
- help determine the most easily acquired aspects of language
- **constrained statistical learning framework**: infants extract statistical regularities (distribution, frequency patterns) from input
- children build their internal phonological system:
	1. what are the phonemes?
	2. how do we combine the phonemes

- **phonemes**: the smallest unit of sound that changes the meaning of a word
- **allophones**: the possible variation of a sound while it is recognized to remain the same sound

- **minimal pairs**: a pair of words that have different meanings, but all of the same sounds with the exception of one phoneme
	- ex. pad/bad, save/safe, bigger/bidder

## Sound Combinations
1. head-turn preference with “real” words and “part” words demonstrates speech perception
2. children learn phonotactic constraints across language
3. children start to recognize words by pulling out sound sequences that have been used repeatedly and separately

## Speech Production
Major systems involved in speech production:
1. *the vocal tract* (larynx to lips): pharynx, nasal cavity, oral cavity
2. *the larynx*: vocal folds, glottis
3. *the sub-glottal system*: lungs, muscles for inhalation/exhalation, trachea

- **source filter theory**: sound from the vocal folds is filtered by the properties of the vocal tract
- **phonation**: production of sound in the *larynx by periodic vibrations of the vocal folds* by rapid opening and closing of the glottis

**Biomechanics of Voice Production**
- *Abduction/adduction* of the vocal folds by movement of the cricoarytenoid joints
- *opening/closing* of the vocal folds during vibration achieved by passive coupling of the aerodynamic forces and the biomechanic characteristics of the vocal folds

**Modulations of the Air Stream**
- modulations of the air stream occur through the vocal tract
- some sounds are produced by opening and closing the glottis (glottal pulsing)
- voiced (or phonated) sounds are made with periodic vibrations in the vocal folds
- compressed air pushed through the vocal tract produces an *a-periodic sound*

**Physiology of Phonatory Control**
- frequency of a string depends upon length, tension, and density
- in vocal folds, it is partly on a string and partly like a spring: length, tension, and mass/unit length interact with one another

**Fundamental Frequency**
- represents the number of vocal-fold cycles per second, abbreviated by F0
- the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform

**Acoustic Characteristics of Phonation**
- *periodic*: pattern repeats every cycle
- *complex*: multiple frequencies are produced, F0 is the lowest frequency produced
	- voice pitch depends mostly on F0
	- intensity decreases as harmonic frequency increases

**Control of F0 within a speaker**
- F0 depends on vocal-fold characteristics:
	- *longer* vocal folds vibrate at lower frequencies
	- *tense* vocal folds vibrate at higher frequencies
	- *less massive* (thinner) vocal folds vibrate at higher frequencies

## The Human Voice
- *voice changes over time*: most significant → change in voice between young boys and adolescent due to the larynx becoming longer and thicker
- *voice and aging*: vocal folds tend to lose elasticity over time, preventing the glottis from closing entirely and stretching, and vocal folds also get thinner

**Alaryngeal forms of speech: alternative voice production techniques**
1. *whispering*: the air in the oral cavity is modulated without vibration of the vocal folds
2. *esophageal speech*: air is sent to the oral cavity from the esophagus and the vibration of this air is modulated in the oral cavity
3. *artificial larynx*: in some cases of surgical removal of the larynx, vibration produced by a device called the electrolarynx held against the cheek can be modulated in the oral cavity

**Speech: Physical Characteristics of the Vocal Tract**
- *phones* are the sounds associated with speech
	1. *articulatory phonetics* is concerned with how the vocal tract is configured to produce each sound
	2. *acoustic phonetics* is the study of the characteristic of the sound wave associated with a particular sound

**Vowels and Consonants**
1. *vowels* are produced when air flow from the lungs is unobstructed, produced with a different configuration of tongue and lip movements
2. *consonants* are produced with more articulatory movement and more constriction than vowels

**When Phonology is Acquired**
- during the first year of life → sets a way of listening to speech sounds that focuses on the phonemes of the language of your environment
- key to all the next steps of language (morphology, syntax, lexical development)
- heavily influences speech perception and speech production

## Conclusions
- within the first year of life, children learn the sounds that are used by speakers of the surrounding languages
- they use discriminating strategies (detecting sound transitions)
- they build their phonemic inventory
- they establish categorical perception
- their phonemic inventory serves as a filter - allowing quick identification of the sounds of their language (the flipside is difficulty and sometimes inability to recognize phonemes of other languages)
