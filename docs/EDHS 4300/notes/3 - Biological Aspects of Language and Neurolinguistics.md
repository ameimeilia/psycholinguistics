# Biological Aspects of Language and Neurolinguistics

## Genetic Basis of Language
- **FOXP2 gene**: discovered in the language disorders of a family (Gopnik, 1990)
- members of the family exhibited symptoms like those of people with a-grammatical aphasia
- attributed to the mutation of the FOXP2 gene
- the intact version of the gene is associated with normal language, but FOXP2 is not **the only** gene for language
- recent evidence suggests that important aspects of language may be associated with the **FOXP2 gene**, seemingly involved in complex movement and coordination
- **damage** leads to difficulty in normal language acquisition

## Challenges to Language Development
**Williams Syndrome**
- 1/7,500-20,000 births
- rare genetic disorder that leads to physical abnormalities, low IQ, *spatial and motor problems*
- 7th chromosome damage, “elfin”-like facial characteristics
- socially outgoing, speech is fluent and grammatically correct, fond of unusual words

**Specific Language Impairment (SLI)**
- development disorder in which children demonstrate unexpected difficulties with the acquisition of spoken language
- difficulties include: lexical acquisition, phonology, morphology, syntax
- SLI is not an “exclusive” language impairment, affects other abilities as well

**Dyslexia**
- a sever limitation in the ability to lean to *decode written language*
- reading is a *complex* skill, including phonological awareness, visual pattern recognition, memory, attention span, good linguistic skills
- the use of written language is a *cultural* phenomenon, not an inborn characteristic
- children with language disorders (SLI) are very likely to have severe reading problems
- reading disorders are more *prevalent* than pure language disorders
- dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is *neurobiological* in origin
- characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or *fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities*
- deficit in the *phonological* component of language, *secondary consequences* may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience

## Neurolinguistics
- **localization**: the attempts to identify regions in brain that are responsible for specific parts of psychological functions
- **lateralization**: the process during which one side of the brain becomes dominant in performing specific functions

**Are Language Functions Localized?**
- brain damage, lesion studies, and brain-imaging techniques
- for 96% of right-handed people, language functions are predominantly localized in the left hemisphere
- 70% of left-handed people are left-hemisphere dominant

**Language has Centers in the Brain**
- “*materialistic*” view (contrary to the dualistic view of mind and body)
- in the materialistic view, activities that we attribute to our mind are activities of the human body
- when you take on a materialistic view, you are *challenged to find the physical eveidence*
- for “mind” phenomena, you are most likely to look into the *brain*
- however, for abstract constructs such as “language,” it is not evident that you will find one center

## Franz-Joseph Gall: the age of phrenology
- the age of phrenology (early 1800s), language is “matter”
- lectured in Vienna on brain functions
- was denounced as a “materialist”
- in 1801, emperor Franz prohibits Gall from teaching as it endangered religion

**Findings:**
- dissection of the brain, compiled maps of the brain
- bulging eyes as indication of strong memory skills localized in frontal area
	- proven wrong by case of *Phineas Gage*
- systematic analysis and comparison of people with specific skills
- 27 mental organs (phrenology)
- localization of function

## Anatomy and Physiology of Language
- **Broca’s Aphasia**: non-halting, effortful speech, trouble with speech production
- **Wernicke’s Aphasia**: fluent meaningless strings of speech, trouble with auditory comprehension

**First Half of 19th Century**
1. Gall: language in frontal lobes (collected clinical data)
2. Marc Dax: 1836 paper reporting that left brain damage entails speech loss more often than right brain damage
3. Bouillaud: gathered reports on patients with language impairment in the anterior part of the brain
5. Auburtin: maintains that speech is to be found in the frontal areas February 1861
6. Broca: demonstrates his case in April 1861

## Paul Broca
- Broca’s aphasia: posterior part of third frontal convolution in left hemisphere
- dysfluent: halting, sparse speech, devoid of recognizable sentence structure
- lateralization: anomalies in the left hemisphere

**Broca’s Views**
- articulated speech is steered from the posterior part of third frontal convolution in *left hemisphere*
- aphasia as a result of damage in the Broca area shows halting, sparse speech, devoid of recognizable sentence structure
- language is in the *left hemisphere* (lateralization) in *right handed people*
- lateralization is a development that takes place during the first years of life (*critical period*)

## Carl Wernicke
- Wernicke’s aphasia - 1874
- situated in the temporal lobe
- fluent aphasia with grammatical structure that is difficult to make sense of

## Traumatic Aphasia
- work of A.R. Luria
- by 1943: 800 cases of brain trauma inflicted by firearms
- 394 had suffered left hemisphere damage, 240 showed signs of speech impairment
- distribution of aphasia is mostly in the central part of the brain, not in the pre-frontal/occipital areas of the brain

- *“sound images”* of object names are stored in Wernicke’s area
- when we speak, this information is sent along a pathway of fibers known as the arcuate fasciculis to Broca’s area
- images are then translated into movements for controlling speech
- Geschwind described how language generation glows from back to front

## Wernicke-Lichtheim classification
<div style="text-align: center;">

- word deafness: inability to comprehend spoken words despite normal hearing

## Penfield and Roberts
- mapped points of electrical simulation producing speech across 273 patients
- language areas are somewhat spread around centers and show variability in their exact location across individuals

## Language and Laterality/Lateralization
- lateralization: the process of one hemisphere taking on a dominant role for a function
- learned by using the Wada test / brain mapping

## Juhn Atsushi Wada
- Japanese-Canadian neuro-researcher
- post-doc with Wilder Penfiled
- developed Wada test
- determined language lateralization by putting one side of the brain to sleep

## Lateralization as Specialization
- areas of the left/right hemisphere become specialized
- or: areas get assigned functions
- information needs to flow within the hemisphere and between hemispheres

## Split-brain

## Dichotic Listening
- different messages are displayed to left/right ear
- stimuli presented to the right ear are often better remembered than those presented to the left ear
- right ear has more direct connections with the left hemisphere

## Accounts of Lateralization
**Equipotentiality Hypothesis**
- 2 hemispheres similar at birth, each able to acquire language processes
- left hemisphere matures to become specialized for language

**Irreversible Determinism Hypothesis**
- left hemisphere specialized for language at birth
- right hemisphere only takes over language functions if the left is damaged over a wide area, involving both the anterior and posterior regions

**Emergentist Account**
- two hemispheres are characterized at birth by innate biases in types of information processing that are not specific to language processing
- e.g. the left hemisphere is better at processing complex sequences
- → the left hemisphere is better suited to bring dominant, although both hemispheres play a role in acquiring language
