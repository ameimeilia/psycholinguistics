# Study Guide 2
## Word Recognition and the Mental Lexicon
- **Listening**
	- 150 words/minute
	- the hearer must take the speech signal and identify what the original phonetic elements were
	- this is complicated because the speech signal is **continuous, in parallel, and variable**
	- **process**:
		1. try to identify the word as the acoustic signal progresses
		2. narrow down until you find a word

</div>
- **Reading**
	- 200-400 words/minute
	- **process**:
		1. scanning the visual word features
		2. compare with words in lexicon
		3. make a decision: is what I see similar enough to what I have in my lexicon?

</div>
- **Word Organization**
	- words are **connected together in complex webs**→ once a lexical item is activated, other “related” words are also activated
	- words are organized as **“neighborhoods”** which can be **sparsely** or **densely populated**
	- dense neighborhoods have many **competitors** for words and vice versa for sparse neighborhoods
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 6.08.37 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot" width="400">
</div>
- **Reaction Time and Other Measures**
	- people respond quickly to impossible words and familiar words, and slower for possible non-words
	- **naming task**: participants are visually presented with a word or object that they have to name; the time it takes a participant to start to pronounce the word aloud is measured
	- **lexical decision task**: participants must decide whether a string of letters is a word or nonword
	- **tachistoscopic identification**: participants are shown words for very short times; thresholds at which participants can no longer confidently identify items are recorded (**subliminal perception**)
- **Priming**
	- residual activation from the previously experienced stimuli
	- encounter a stimulus → activate its mental representation → **you activate associates** of that stimulus
	- **types of priming**:
		- **semantic/associative priming**: meaning relationship between the prime and target word (ex. beer, wine)
		- **form priming**: the prime and the target are not related semantically, but are related in their phonological form (ex. beer, deer)
		- **masked priming**: the prime word is presented so quickly that it is not consciously processed, but will result in the priming effect
		- **repetition priming**: once you have identified a word, it becomes easier to identify it the next time
- **Semantic Conflict**
	- **Stroop test**: interference in the reaction time of the naming and recognition task (ex. “yellow” written in the color blue)
- **Zipf’s law**
	- the most frequent word is twice as frequent as the second
	- the most frequent word is three times as frequent as the the third
	- …
	- general rule: frequent words are recognized faster

  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 5.53.44 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot" width="500">
</div>
-  **Polysemous Words**
	- words need context to be useful → bottom up or top down
	- when initially hearing a word, all meanings are activated, then wrong meanings are deactivated
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 5.59.38 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot">
</div>
- **Cohort Model of Lexical Access**
	- **acoustic information** is rapidly transformed into **phonological information** and lexical entries that match the stimulus phonologically are activated
	- activate **all** lexical entries in **cohort** → then narrow down as more phonemes are heard → reach **recognition point**

- **Speech Perception**
	- process:
		1. use acoustic info to locate word in lexicon
		2. re-check word with acoustic signal (**post-access matching**)
		3. full phonological representation is perceived
	- **The Motor Theory of Speech Perception** by **Liberman, Cooper**, et al: listening activates the listener’s **internal motor system** and they **simulate** the speaker’s mouth movement in their mind
	- **McGurk effect**: auditory component of one sound + visual component of another sound = perception of third sound (hear “ba” + see “ga” = perceive “da”)
	- **Phonemic Restoration**: people hear words from which a phoneme has been removed/masked through noise
	- **Ganong Effect**: perceive an ambiguous speech sound as a phoneme that would complete a real word, rather than completing a nonsense/fake word
	- **slips of the ear**: occur when there is background noise or when the hearer is distracted (in songs are called **Mondegreens**)
	- **perceptual illusion**: tendency by listeners to localize the sound where the moving mouth is (ex. ventriloquism)
- **Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down**
	- **bottom-up**: when details of the acoustic signal help you build a phonological representation
	- **top-down**: information that is not part of the acoustic signal (context) helps you build a phonological representation

## From Intention to Articulation
- **Producing Speech**
	- **preverbal message**: the idea or information that speaker intends to communicate
	- idea matches with all **necessary linguistic information** then encoded into an utterance
- **Planning Speech**
	- **Operations/Representations**
		1. Lexical: choosing words
		2. Syntactic: deciding on and building the sentence structure
		3. Morphological: word endings, inflections
		4. Phonological: identifying the sounds
		
	- **Steps**
		1. create a representation of the intended sentence meaning
		2. a lexical search is triggered for the words
		3. assign syntactic structure to the words retrieved from lexicon
		4. phonological representation can be created
		5. instructions are generated for the vocal apparatus
		6. speech signal is created
- **Speech Errors**
	- **Spoonerisms**: initial sounds of two words get swapped → indication of how linguistic information is stored and organized
	- **Freudian Slip**: slips of the tongue, Freud believed revealed repressed thoughts (can also happen in sign language and written language)
		- **anticipation errors**: sound/word produced earlier than intended
		- **perseveration errors**: sound/word repeated
		- **exchange errors**: sounds/words swap places
		- **omission errors**: sound/word left out
- **Speech Error Suggestions about Speech Production**
	- speech is planned in advance
	- the lexicon is organized both semantically and phonologically
	- morphologically complex words are assembled
	- affixes and functors behave differently from content words in slips of the tongue
	- speech errors reflect rule knowledge
- **Accessing the Lexicon**
	- 100-300 words/minute
	- the lexicon is organized by **frequency of use, meaning, and phonological structure**
- **Lexicalization**
	- the process of finding, selecting a word, and preparing it to be spoken
	- two-stage process:
		1. **lexical selection**: choosing the word based on **meaning**/grammar (**lemma** level)
		2. **phonological encoding**: retrieving/assembling the sounds of these words (**lexeme** level / form level)
	- evidence for two stages: **speech errors, neuroscience, tip-of-the-tongue**

  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-10-31 at 5.59.34 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot" width="500">
</div>
- **Tip of the tongue phenomenon**
	- **inability to activate speech because insufficient access to the lexical element**
	- **partial activation hypothesis**: indication of 2-part lexicaliztation
	- **blocking hypothesis**: target item is suppressed by a stronger competitor

  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-10-31 at 6.00.01 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot" width="500">
</div>
- **Syntactics**
	- **word order** rules:
		1. SVO order
		2. topic → comment
		3. old information → new information
	- **syntactic priming**: speakers tend to **reuse the syntactic constructions of other speakers** (evidence that form (syntax) and content (semantics) are two separate phenomena?)
	- **number-agreement errors**: number agreement between subjects and verbs is incorrect
- **Phonological Encoding: Frame-based Models**
	- linguistic structures create **frames** with slots, and we retrieve linguistic content to fill these slots
	- sound segments are retrieved separately and **inserted into appropriate slots** in a syllabic frame
	- when we speak, we produce an abstract frame for the upcoming phrase
- **Hesitations**
	- **unfilled pause**: is simply a moment of silence
	- **filled hesitation**: can be filled pause, a repetition, a false start, or a parenthetical remark

## Bilingualism
- **Bilingualism**
	- interest in linguistic potential, effects educationally, economically, and culturally
	- created by geographical/political conditions, immigration/emigration, colonization, economic/professional motivations, linguistically blended families/neighborhoods
- **Terminology**
	- **L1**: first language learned
	- **L2**: second language learned
	- **simultaneous bilingualism**: L1 and L2 learned around the same time
	- **early sequential bilingualism**: L1 learned first, but L2 learned relatively early (largest group worldwide)
	- **late bilingualism**: learned in adolescence +
	- **Semi-Lingualism/Limited Bilingualism**: individuals who are not competent in either their first or second language
	- **additive bilingualism**: high levels of proficiency in both first and second languages
	- **subtractive bilingualism**: first language **replaced** by the second language (attrition)
- **Diary Study of Leopold (1939-1949)**
	- move from Germany to America
	- showed that young children can quickly forget the old language and pick up a new one if they move to another country
	- initially the two languages are mixed up, but differentiation quickly emerges
- **Growing Up Bilingual**
	- children are able **to identify and distinguish the languages in their environment**
	- **OPOL principle**: provides clues for distinction between languages
		- **1913 Jules Ronjat Study**: raise child speaking German with him and French with his wife
		- **1935 Smith Study**: OPOL children of missionaries in China outperformed younger kids raised with mixed language
	- children growing up bilingual often develop **meta-linguistic awareness** sooner than typical children
	- bilingual children show lower vocabulary scores during preschool years
	- children need at least **20 hours of exposure** to a language/week for productive learning
- **Bilingual Language Processing**
	- **separate-store models**: there are separate lexicons for each language
	- **common-store models**: there is ONE lexicon and ONE semantic memory system, with words from both languages stored in it and connected directly together
- **In Terms of Development**
	- **separate underlying proficiency model (SUP)**: proficiency in the first language is viewed as entirely separate from proficiency in the second language
	- **common underlying proficiency model (CUP)**: linguistic development in any language provides a basis that will be helpful for learning another language (most evidence for this model)
- **Processes that Co-occur with L2 Learning**
	- **interference**: the process wherein a language behavior from the first language is carried over to the second language
	- **fossilization**: a specific second language “error” is firmly entrenched in the second language, even though the person is very proficient in the second language
- **Is L1 hindering L2?**
	- **Pieter Muysken**: 2nd language learners may have **a lack of access to UG**, because the first language has set parameters in an irreversible way
		- attentive to certain things in one language but can’t reset for second language
- **The Ethno-linguistic Effect**
	- language can function as a social and personal identity marker
	- social identity indicates a group membership
	- **a majority ethno-linguistic community**: language has high social status and is widely used
	- **a minority ethno-linguistic community**: language has lower social status, is less valued, and may be associated with little socio-economic power
	- Cummins: **“Bilingualism is good for the rich but bad for the poor”**
- **Saer (1923)**: concluded that bilingualism negatively impacts intelligence, but experiment didn’t account for factors in bilingualism and incorrectly associated language with “world view” and social identity
- **Bilingual Proficiency**
	- **monolingual norm assumption**: the belief that monolingualism is norm, child’s cognitive system is fragile and only designed to cope with one language (sometimes called the **“limited capacity hypothesis”**)
	- **maintenance bilingual education**: culturally appropriate learning experiences in the first language while learning the second language
	- **BICS**: basic interpersonal communication skills, takes approximately **2 years** to develop to the same level as a native speaker
	- **CALP**: cognitive academic language proficiency, takes between **5-7 years** to develop to the same level as a native speaker
	- can take up to 7-10 years for CALP to develop to a native-like level **under less than optimal** conditions
- **Context-embedded and Context-reduced communication**
	- **context-embedded communication**: participants can actively negotiate meaning and they have a shared reality
	- **context-reduced communication**: does not assume a shared reality, it may rely exclusively on linguistic cues for meaning

- **Bilingual Language Processing**
	- **cognates**: words that have a common etymological origin
	- **culturally similar words**: act as though they are **stored in common**
	- **abstract and other words**: act as though they are in **separate** stores
- **Bilingual Syntactic Processing**
	- **particular syntactic structure** in one language could make it easier to use the same structure in the second language → **“shared syntax”**
- **Moving Between Languages**
	- **Kroll and Stewart**: translate words from first language → second language (**forward translation**)
	- use **conceptual mediation**: must access the meaning of the word to translate it
	- **backwards translation**: translate from second language → first by **word association**
	- we can direct links between items in the lexicon
	- **translation in both directions** involves going through the **semantic representation** of the words

- **The Neuroscience of Bilingualism**
	- **bilinguals with right hemisphere damage show more aphasia** than monolinguals
	- brain damage usually results in **differential recovery** of two lanaguages but sometimes can result in **selective impairment** of one language
	- suggests 2 independent language systems connected at the conceptual level
	- time of acquisition most affects the grammatical aspects of language
	- lexicons of both early and late bilinguals are organized similarly
- **Second Language Acquisition**
	- why is it difficult?
		- **critical period**
		- older children and adults often have **less time and motivation** to learn a second language
		- the **“less is more”** hypothesis: children have smaller world when younger
	- **contrastive hypothesis**: the learner will experience difficulty when L1 and L2 differ
- **L2 Teaching Methods**
	- **traditional method**: based on translation from one to another, with lectures in grammar in the primary language (translation method)
	- **direct methods**: carry out all teaching in L2, with emphasis on conversational skills
	- **audiolingual method**: emphasizes speaking and listening before reading and writing
	- **immersion method**: teaches a group of learners exclusively through the medium of the foreign language
	- **submersion method**: the learner is surrounded exclusively by speakers of L2, usually in the foreign country
- **Krashen 5 Hypotheses, the Monitor Model**
	1. **acquisition and learning distinction hypothesis**: children acquire L1 largely unconsciously and automatically, they do not learn it
	2. **natural order in acquisition hypothesis**: order of acquisition of syntactic rules and the types of errors of generalization made, are the same in both languages
	3. **monitor hypothesis**: acquisition processes create sentences in the second language, but learning enables the development of a monitoring process to check and edit this output
	4. **comprehensible input hypothesis**: in order to move from one stage to the next, the acquirer must understand the meaning and form of the input
	5. **active filter hypothesis**: attitude and emotional factors are important in L2 acquisition and account for a lot of difference in the facility with which adults and children can learn a second language
- **John Carroll (1916-2003)**
	- identified 4 sources of variation on people’s ability to learn a new language:
		1. **phonetic coding ability**
		2. **grammatical sensitivity**
		3. **rote-learning ability**
		4. **inductive learning ability**
	- **language learning aptitude**: prediction of how well, relative to other individuals, an individual can learn a foreign language in a given amount of time under given conditions
- **Keith Sharpe**
	- 1992: “four C’s” of successful modern language teaching:
		1. **communication**
		2. **culture**
		3. **context**
		4. **confidence**
	- simple rote repetition is best for learning to produce the new words, using keywords is best for comprehension
- **Observations in Second Language Learning**
	1. **Silent Period**: pre-production phase, focus on listening and comprehension
	2. **Language Loss**: new language gradually replaces the first language
	3. **Language Transfer (interference)**: a characteristic or feature of the first language is carried over into the second language
	4. **Inter-language**: period of learner using language productively until they achieve native-speaker competence
	5. **Code-switching**: ability to easily switch from one code to the other in response to environmental **cues**
	6. **Code-mixing**: language alternation within a sentence
- **Variables that Affect 2nd Language Learning**
	- use of **routines** and standard expressions
	- **high vs low input generators**
		- high: extravert, seeking opportunities, low anxiety
		- low: less assertive, creating less opportunities

## Language and Speech Diversity
- **Speech, Language and Diversity**
	- speech and language use is pathological when it is the result of an **absence or distortion of structures or functions**
	- **patholinguistics**: study of language disorders
- **Speech and the Speech Organs**
	- we use speech organs to produce sounds in a **perceptually (binary) decodable system (phonology)**
	- not all sounds are speech sounds
	- we are **not using our speech organs fully**
- **Speech and Evolution**
	- **no proper speech organs** (speech organs have original non-speech related functions)
	- **evolutionary linguistics**: studies how language has emerged as part of human evolution
		- **hypothesis**: language evolved as an adaptation shaped by natural selection
		- **alternative hypothesis**: language emerged as a side effect of something else (brain size, increase in general intelligence, upright walking)
	- language capacity must have arisen when **homo sapiens** became differentiated from other species and brain increased in size and complexity
	- **Broca’s area** was present in the brains of hominids 2 millions years ago
- **The Monogenesis and Polygenesis Hypotheses**
	- **monogenesis**: all languages descend from one proto-human language
	- **poly-genesis**: the same cognitive linguistic organization that allows the emergence of a languages causes the birth of language in separate communities around the world
- **Linguicide/Linguicism**
	- **linguicide**: death of a language from natural or political causes
	- **linguicism**: bias, discrimination, harassment, maltreated based on language stereotypes
- **Influence of Speech Modeling and Language Style Environment**
	- people in environment provide us **speech models**
	- especially effective in younger years, when an internal phonology is being built
	- result of local and geographical differences
- **Sociolect, Dialect, Idiolect**
	- **sociolect**: a variety of language use that is related to a social or socioeconomic group
		- professional jargon, youth slang, internet and text speak
	- **dialect**: a variety of language as used by a group, often determined by geographical regions or localities
	- **idiolect**: a variety of language use by one individual (we all have our individual way of speaking and using language)
		- choice of vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar and syntax
	- **ecolect**: the way a language is used with a small group (such as a household)
		- pet names and vocabulary, inside jokes and phrases, culinary terms
- **Sociophonetic Markers**
	- **socio-phonetic variation**: the way speech is produced is influenced by social environemnt (and identity factors)
	- you adopt phonetic characteristics and style from speakers around you and speakers you identify with

## Language Disorders
- **Language Development: Hearing Impaired**
	- **main factor**: lack of exposure and access
	- implications for:
		- phonological, morphological, syntactic development
		- semantic and lexical development
		- pragmatic development
		- form, function, and use of language
- **3 Levels of Language Disorders**
	1. processing disorder: ex. word finding problems
	2. production disorders
	3. receptive disorders
- **Production Disorders**
	1. **Dysarthria**: impaired articulatory ability resulting from defects in the peripheral motor nerves or in the speech musculature
	2. **Apraxia of speech**: person has trouble saying what they want to say correctly and consistently
	3. **Fluency disorders**: normal flow of speech is disrupted by repetitions or hesitations
- **Locked-in Syndrome**: damage to brainstem → almost completely paralyzed while remaining conscious
- **Spastic Dysarthria**: damage to motor neurons in brain → Speech is slow, effortful, and has a harsh vocal quality
- **ALS** (Amytrophic lateral sclerosis): progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord
- **Stuttering**: caused by differences in brain structure/function, can be triggered by ceratin linguistic elements, results in psychological effects
- **Childhood Language Disorders**
	- childhood and congenital aphasia
	- **dysphasia**: language disorder that affects ability to understand and produce language
	- language delay
	- **language deviance**: child's development occurs in a different sequence or rate than is typical
	- specific language impairment (SLI)
- **Language Problems Include:**
	- lexical problems (semantic problems)
	- syntactic problems
	- phonological problems
	- articulation problems
	- pragmatic problems (also some semantic problems)
