# Study Guide 1
## What is Psycholinguistics?
- **psycholinguistics**: study of how the mind works in relation to how language is built
- **main domains of psycholinguistics**
	1. how people/children acquire language
	2. how people use language
	3. how language is represented and processed in the brain

- **challenge**: are there instances where only language is damaged by not other mental functions?
- even if there is modularity, the different modules interact (ex. specific language impairment)

- **challenge**: consider sign languages? Are the sounds of a language really meaningless?
- **Kinesthetic Symbolism**: association between certain sounds and shapes → challenges abstract phonetics

- **communication**: the transmission of a signal that conveys information, can be **intentional or non-intentional**
- **signal**: the means that conveys the information
	1. ants: pheromones
	2. honey bees: dance
- communication can take on **several forms**/types of signals

- language is key to understand the **mental potential of humans** because it is one of the most **complex skills**
- **languages are creative and human**
	- speaks can create and understand **novel** sentences with no conscious effort
	- every language consists of a set of principles that has an **infinite number** of combinations
	- animals communicate certain info but humans can talk about **anything**
- **language**: a structured system of symbols that contains a lexicon and combinatorial principles
- languages can be expressed in different **modalities**, mainly speech and writing
- most languages are expressed in the **spoken modality**, while sign languages are expressed in the **gestural modality**
- **organization of language**:
	1. **language**: a formal system for pairing systems with meanings
	2. **grammar**: the set of rules that creates sentences in a language
	3. **lexicon**: the set of words of a language
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-08-29 at 5.42.25 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot" width="500">
</div>
- **grammar**:
	- the description of language as a system
	- **prescriptive grammar**: knowing how to adapt to the standard way of speaking or writing (professional use of language)
	- **descriptive grammar**: is the language system that underlies ordinary use
	- **phoneme inventory**: the sounds of a language
	- **phonological rules**: the sounds pattern of the language, including: making words, intonation, and rhythm
	- **morphological rules**: how meaningful combinations of sounds are formed
	- **syntactic rules**: structural organization of words and sentences
		- **syntax**: when processing a sequence of words, words are matched with their meaning and their sequence within the structure
- **lexicon**:
	- all the information known about a word, including; sounds, meaning, written appearance, syntactic roles
	- mental lexicon: internal dictionary of all the words a person knows and the linguistic information connected with each
	- **lexical semantics**: meanings of words
	- lexical access is fast and indicates that language users have an efficient lexical organization

- **speech**: use of the human voice to produce **acoustic signals** that represent linguistic structures
- spoken languages are tailored toward production with the human voice
- **acoustics**: the physical characteristics of sound
	- characteristics of sound: frequency and amplitude
- **phonetics**: the production and perception of speech sounds
	- **acoustic phonetics**: the physical characteristics of speech sounds
- **phonology**: the sound system of a language (sounds that go together / don’t go together)
	- **phoneme inventory**: the sounds of a certain language
	- **phoneme combinations**: each phonology dictates which combinations are possible
- **morphemes**
	- phonemes combine to form **morphemes**: the smallest unit of language that have meaning
	- inflectional morphology: walk - walked, go - went, apple - apples
	- derivational morphology: social - sociologist - think - thinker
	- morphology can operate as an autonomous component: ex. inflectional morphology of a fictitious word

- **linguistic competence**: intuitive knowledge of a language user that enables the creative production and understanding of all sentences
- **linguistic performance**: the use of such knowledge in the actual processing of sentences, together with skills and factors such a planning, attention, and memory
- **meta-linguistic awareness**: ability to think consciously about language and linguistic objects (sounds, words, sentences)

- **production of language**: thought → lexicon → syntactic encoding → linguistic encoding → speech
- **perception**: phonological decoding → lexicon → syntactic decoding → understanding
- **acquisition of language**:
	- similarities in the way children acquire their native language
	- language is acquired rapidly → suggest biological underpinning
	- second language acquisition is usually more difficult
- **summary**
	- Linguistic theory forces us to investigate psychological questions  
	- Psycholinguistics uses linguistic models to generate psychological questions  
	- Psycholinguistics focuses on language acquisition, language processing, organization of language in the brain.

## Where does language come from?
- **nativist view**: humans are born with language → universal grammar
- **anti-nativist view**: language is a tool that is developed by humans everywhere
- **The Origin of Speech** by **Charles Hockett**
	1. **vocal auditory channel**: language is produced in the vocal tract and transmitted as sound → language was synonymous with speech
	2. **arbitrariness**: the meaningful associations between language and the world are arbitrary
	3. **discreteness**: the units of language are separate and distinct from one another
	4. **duality of patterning**: a small number of units that don’t convey meanings on their own can be used to create a very large number of symbols which combine again, following specific syntax rules
- **animal communication systems**:
	- based on codes, **mimicry** → limited **repertoire**
	- have some **combinatorics** and serve survival functions
	- **Clever Hans effect**: animals that appear to know language are sometimes just picking up cues from their owner
- **human language in primates**
	- primates display no evidence of using skills in a **natural environment**
	- points to interaction between **cognitive capacity and language**
	- 2 categories of skills that **support language**:
		1. skills necessary to get language off the ground but aren’t specific to language (ex. symbol understanding)
		2. skills that evolved particularly because they make language more power and efficient (ex. combinatorial capacity)
	- in child development: pointing, reaching, labeling, and communication are intertwined vs. **primates do not understand pointing**
- **early language skills and socialization**
	- need **cooperative attitude** to communicate based on **complex set of implicit rules**
	- importance of **joint attention** (developed during the first year of life)
	- primates can never communicate like humans since the **vocal anatomy** of human/chimpanzees is different
- **Noam Chomsky** (1959)
	- challenged the traditional view of language which focused on **vocal** behavior
	- argued that **speech** should *not* be the object of study for human language, instead the **underlying rules** (in the mind) that are not observable
	- argued that language is **infinite and always new (generative)** → **behaviorism** suggests a **finite number of behaviors**
	- **grammatical components**: syntax, morphology, phonology
	- 3 factors:
		1. **innate endowment**: genetic endowment that leads a child to reflexively seek evidence that is linguistically relevant
		2. **external endowment**: environment
		3. **neurological properties/learning principles**: computational efficiency, mutations over time allowed the development of a cognitive-linguistic system
- **biological predisposition**
	- languages across the world all share common aspects → suggest language is part of human biological endowment
	- **universal grammar** and acquisition strategies must be biological
	- **language acquisition device**: the portion of the brain with a predisposition for acquiring language

</div>
- **speech and language in children**
	- early on, children discover that vocal sound production can be modulated through **babbling**
	- **reduplicated babble**: repetition of consonant-vowel syllables, often producing the same pair for a long time (ex. “ba ba ba”)
	- **non-reduplicated/variegated babble**: strings of non-repeated syllables
	- **continuity hypothesis**: babbling is a direct precursor of language
	- **discontinuity hypothesis**: babbling bears no simple relation to later development (it is pure motor practice)
- **evolution of language**
	1. **Origin**
		- Genesis 11:1-9: languages are God-given, language is “created on the spot”
	2. **Creationism / Evolution**
		- *Condillac* (1715-1780): French philosopher who believed that language must have *evolved* over time
		- John Locke, Adam Smith, and others agreed
		- argued for a gradual development of a semiotic system out of calls and *gestures*
	3. **Modern Day**
		- *continuous* views: evolutionary
		- *discontinuous views*: linguistic “big bang”
	- languages are **dynamic** and constantly changing (words stop being used, lose meaning, borrow words)
- **where language came from**
	- *hypothesis*: language evolved as an adaptation shaped by natural selection
	- *alternative*: it arose as a side effect of something else (ex. increase in brain size, increase in general intelligence, etc)
- **gestural first languages?**
	- **hypothesis**: earliest forms of human language were gestural
	- **evidence**: apes in the wild use gestures, young children use gestures before they can speak, gestures are everywhere and connected to speech
- **language development in deaf people**
	- **Susan Goldin-Meadow**: deaf children without a signing model developed their own manual signs
- **the kendon continuum (adam kendon)**
	- **spontaneous gesticulation**: gesturing in rhythm of speech
	- **language-like gesture**: gesture that conveys meaning with speech
	- **pantomime**: gesture that represents a story/idea, non-verbal
	- **emblem**: gesture with specific conventional meaning
	- **sign language**: fully developed gestural language
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
- **gestural systems → sign languages**
	- sign languages are used and have **developed naturally**
	- sign languages are just as **structured** as spoken languages and are capable of conveying an **unlimited range of topics**
	- the only difference between signed and spoken languages is the **transmission mode**
- **wllliam stokoe model of sign structure**
	- signs have **parts** as words have parts
	- each sign is composed of three parts:
		1. **location**: the placement on the signer’s body where the sign is made
		2. **handshape**: the configuration of the hands in the sign
		3. **movement**: how the hands/arms move in forming a sign; a sign may have up to three movements
- **linguistic universals**
	- might be due to the **innate component** of **grammar** or **cognition**
	- constraints on **syntactic processing** make some word orders easier to process
- **Pidgin**: simplified languages created for communication between speakers of different languages forced into prolonged contact
- **Creole**: a pidgin language that has become the native tongue of the children of the pidgin speakers

## Biological Aspects of Language and Neurolinguistics
- **Genetic Basis of Language**
	- **FOXP2 gene**: involved in complex movement and coordination → mutation leads to language disorders/difficulty in normal language acquisition, not **the only** gene for language
- **Challenges to Language Development**
	- reading is a **complex** skill, written language is a *cultural* phenomenon
	- reading disorders are more *prevalent* than pure language disorders
	1. **Williams Syndrome**: low IQ but speech is fluent and grammatically correct, fond of unusual words
	2. **Specific Language Impairment (SLI)**: regular IQ but difficulties with the acquisition of spoken language
		- children with SLI are likely to also have **reading problems**
	3. **Dyslexia**: difficulty in **fluent word recognition, poor spelling, ability to decode written language**
		- dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is *neurobiological* in origin
		- deficit in the *phonological* component of language, *secondary consequences* may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience
- **Neurolinguistics**
	- **localization**: the attempts to identify regions in brain that are responsible for specific parts of psychological functions
	- **lateralization**: the process during which one side of the brain becomes dominant in performing specific functions
- **Franz-Joseph Gall**
	- **phrenology**: specific mental faculties are localized in different regions of the brain
	- language is “matter,” **materialist vs dualist**
	- **findings:**
		- dissection of the brain, compiled maps of the brain
		- bulging eyes as indication of strong memory skills localized in frontal area
			- proven wrong by case of **Phineas Gage**: damage to left frontal lobe, retained language skills but underwent personality change
- **Anatomy and Physiology of Language**
	1. **Broca’s Aphasia**: non-halting, effortful speech, trouble with speech production
	2. **Wernicke’s Aphasia**: fluent meaningless strings of speech, trouble with auditory comprehension
- **Paul Broca**
	- **Broca’s aphasia**: dysfluent, halting, sparse speech, devoid of recognizable sentence structure
	- **Broca’s Views**
		- language is in the *left hemisphere* (lateralization) in *right handed people*
		- lateralization is a development that takes place during the first years of life (*critical period*)
- **Carl Wernicke**
	- **Wernicke’s aphasia**: fluent aphasia with grammatical structure that is difficult to make sense of
- **Traumatic Aphasia**
	- work of **A.R. Luria**
	- left hemisphere damage from firearms correlated to speech impairment
	- distribution of aphasia is mostly in the **central part** of the brain, not in the pre-frontal/occipital areas of the brain
- **Broca vs Wernicke aphasia**

- **“sound images”** of object names are stored in Wernicke’s area → sent to Broca’s area when speaking and translated into movements for controlling speech

**Wernicke-Lichtheim classification**
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-09-24 at 5.29.45 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot">
</div>
- **word deafness**: inability to comprehend spoken words despite normal hearing
- **Penfield and Roberts**
	- mapped points of electrical simulation producing speech
	- **findings**:
		- language localized in left hemisphere and especially around **Broca’s and Wernicke’s Area**
		- there is **individual variability** in the exact location of language centers

- **Language and Lateralization**
	- **Juhn Atsushi Wada** developed **Wada** test: put one side of the brain to sleep and test capabilities of the other side
	- 96% of right-handed people/70% of left-handed people: **language localized in left hemisphere**
	- areas of the brain can become **specialized** or assigned functions → information needs to flow within the hemisphere and between hemispheres
- **Split-brain**
	- right visual field processed by left hemisphere and vice versa
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ '/images/Screenshot 2024-09-24 at 6.07.56 PM.png' | relative_url}}" alt="Screenshot" width="500">
</div>
- **Dichotic Listening**
	- stimuli presented to the right ear are often better remembered than those presented to the left ear
	- right ear has more direct connections with the left hemisphere
- **Accounts of Lateralization**
	1. **Equipotentiality Hypothesis**
		- 2 hemispheres have equal potential to acquire language at birth but the left hemisphere matures to become specialized for language
	2. **Irreversible Determinism Hypothesis**
		- left hemisphere specialized for language at birth but right will take over if left is damaged	
	3. **Emergentist Account**
		- 2 hemispheres have are inclined to different skills at birth and the left has skills that suit language acquisition

## The Sounds of Language
- **Sound Patterns in Babies**
	- before babies begin to produce words, babies can:
		1. **differentiate their native language** from other languages
		2. have a sense of how **streams of sounds are sliced** into words
		3. give special attention to **distinctions in sounds that will be especially useful** for signaling different meanings
		4. figure out how sounds can be “legally” combined into words in their own language (**phonotactics**)
	- **head-turn preference** with “real” words and “part” words demonstrates **speech perception**
- **Biological Predisposition**
	- **acquisition strategies** enable the child to take the input from the environment and construct a grammar the conforms to the **organizational principles** of universal grammar
	- **constrained statistical learning framework**: infants extract statistical regularities (distribution, frequency patterns) from input
	- after one year, babies can recognize **phonemes**
		- establishes a way of paying attention to certain speech sounds
		- key to all the next steps of language → heavily influences speech perception and speech production
- **vocabulary**
	- **phonemes**: the smallest unit of sound that changes the meaning of a word
	- **allophones**: possible pronunciations of a single phoneme
	- **minimal pairs**: a pair of words that have different meanings, but all of the same sounds with the exception of one phoneme
		- ex. pad/bad, save/safe, bigger/bidder
- **Speech Production**
	- Major systems involved in speech production: **vocal tract, larynx, sub-glottal system**
	- **source filter theory**: sound from the vocal folds is filtered by the properties of the vocal tract
	- **phonation**: production of sound in the **larynx by periodic vibrations of the vocal folds** by rapid abduction/adduction of the glottis
		- *periodic*: pattern repeats every cycle
		- *complex*: multiple frequencies are produced, F0 is the lowest frequency produced
- **The Human Voice**
	- F0 depends on vocal-fold characteristics: length, tension, thickness
	- *voice changes over time*: most significant → change in voice between young boys and adolescent due to the larynx becoming longer and thicker
	- *voice and aging*: vocal folds tend to lose elasticity over time, preventing the glottis from closing entirely and stretching, and vocal folds also get thinner
- **Alaryngeal forms of speech: alternative voice production techniques**
	1. *whispering*: the air in the oral cavity is modulated without vibration of the vocal folds
	2. *esophageal speech*: air is sent to the oral cavity from the esophagus and the vibration of this air is modulated in the oral cavity
	3. *artificial larynx*: in some cases of surgical removal of the larynx, vibration produced by a device called the electrolarynx held against the cheek can be modulated in the oral cavity
- **Speech: Physical Characteristics of the Vocal Tract**
	- *phones* are the sounds associated with speech
		1. *articulatory phonetics* is concerned with how the vocal tract is configured to produce each sound
		2. *acoustic phonetics* is the study of the characteristic of the sound wave associated with a particular sound
- **Vowels and Consonants**
	1. *vowels* are produced when air flow from the lungs is unobstructed, produced with a different configuration of tongue and lip movements
	2. *consonants* are produced with more articulatory movement and more constriction than vowels

## The Words of Language
- words are social constructs and are the result of *conventionalization* → essentially *arbitrary*
- **Acquiring Words**
	1. first word around first birthday
	2. 50 words around 18-24 months
	3. **vocabulary spurt** → growth to 10,000s of words
		- 4-8 words everyday
		- **fast mapping**: when a child hears a word once or twice, learns its grammatical class, but has only a vague sense of what it means

	- combination of **production** (saying words) and a **reception** (recognizing words)
	- match productions with **internal representation** of a word
	- babies pay attention to **differences** but not to “similar” words
	- **”less is more”**: infants have limited experiences which will make it easier to build internal language
- **Mechanisms of Word Learning**
	- **associative learning**: association between word and an object, person, event, characteristic in the environment
	- **reinforcement**: through repetition/generalization
	- children learn best through **human interaction**
	- **joint attention**: children pay attention to the speaker’s intention to determine the meaning of a word
	- **whole-object bias**: the theoretical assumption by babies that a new word heard in the context of a salient object refers to the whole thing and not to its parts
- **Strategies children use to figure out word meanings**
	1. *reference*: assume that words map to objects, actions and attributes
	2. *extendability*: assume that words label more than just the original referent
		- *overextension*: when the child will extend a word incorrectly to similar things
		- *under-extension*: the child will acquire a word for a particular thing and fail to extend it to other objects in the same category
	3. *object scope*: assume that words that appear to map to objects map to the whole opject
	4. *novel name - nameless category*: assume that novel words map to concepts for which you do not yet have a name
	5. *conventionality*: assume that speakers prefer specific rather than general terms
- **Lexical difficulties** can include lexical growth and lexical organization: phonological, syntactic, semantic
- **Learning in context**
	- **social** - communicative context: who is saying what, when , which accompanying events, etc
	- **linguistic context**: words are stringed together
	- **syntactic bootstrapping**: words, presented in their syntactic frames, provide a source of information about their meaning
- **Morphological Structures to Understand Words**
	- the morphological system helps us to **generate and organize** words following certain **hierarchical** rules
	- morphemes are an indication of how much a child is **able to build language** with the smallest meaningful elements
	- **”Wug” study**: demonstrate children’s ability to understand morphological rules with fictious words
- **Regular vs. irregular verbs**
	- developing children conjugate irregular verbs following regular patterns
	- people with Parkinson’s disease or Broca aphasia may have difficulties with regular verbs
- **Mean length of utterance**
	- MLU = total number of morphemes / total number of utterances
	- sentences become longer when the child’s working memory becomes large enough to hold more info at a given time
- **Language and Thought**
	- **hypotheses**:
		1. cognitive development determines the course of language development
		2. language and cognition are independent
		3. language and cognition become interdependent
	- **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis**: the form of our language **determines** the structure of our thought process
- **Whorf linguistic relativism**
	- compared Indian American languages (Hopi) with SAE
		- SAE: “in the morning”
		- Hopi: “while the morning phase is passing”
	- “All observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated”
- **Brown and Lenneberg**:
	- highly codable colors with simple color names are more easily remembered
	- supports **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis**: the way we categorize the world in language influences how we process/remember it
- **Coding of Space and Time**
	- the ways different languages encode distinctions influence the ways in which speakers think
	- suggest that languages influence how we perform on tasks that seem to not involve language at all
